            <h2> Glasgow Harbour </h2>
                <p> The 8 years leading up to the First World War saw Glasgow Harbour undergo massive expansion. In this time the riverside quays were extended along both the north and south banks of the Clyde as far downstream as the neighbouring burghs of Govan and Partick. By 1914 the quays following the line of the river provided nearly 11 miles of accommodation for all types of shipping. To cope with the tonnage and variety of cargo handled four great tidal basins or docks were also constructed. These were Kingston Dock, Queen's Dock, Prince's Dock, and Rothesay Dock. <a href="https://www.theglasgowstory.com/story/?id=TGSDD05">Read more...</a> </p>

            <h2> Glasgow City Chambers </h2>
                <p> Glasgow City Chambers was designed by William Young, the winner of a competition that attracted 125 entries. Lord Provost Ure laid the foundation stone on 6 October 1883 and declared the day a public holiday in the city. The building was opened by Queen Victoria in 1888. The sheer scale and lavishness of the City Chambers was an affirmation of the city's increasing importance and wealth at the end of the 19th century. The block covers about 62,000 square feet with a quadrangle in the centre, an impressive tower and carriage entries to the north and south. <a href="https://www.theglasgowstory.com/image/?inum=TGSA01186">Read more...</a> </p>

            <h2> Glasgow Cathedral </h2>
                <p> This medieval cathedral is thought to have been built on the site of St Kentigern’s tomb and marks the birthplace of the city of Glasgow. One of Scotland's most magnificent medieval buildings, Glasgow Cathedral is the only one on the Scottish mainland to survive the Reformation of 1560 intact. Glasgow Cathedral is built on the site where St Kentigern, or Mungo, is thought to have been buried in AD 612. St Kentigern was the first bishop within the ancient British kingdom of Strathclyde, and the present cathedral was built during the 13th - 15th centuries. <a href="https://www.visitscotland.com/info/see-do/glasgow-cathedral-p254881">Read more...</a> </p>

            <h2> George Square </h2>
                <p> George Square is the principal civic square in the city of Glasgow, Scotland. It is one of six squares in the city centre, the others being Cathedral Square, St Andrew's Square, St Enoch Square, Royal Exchange Square, and Blythswood Square on Blythswood Hill. Named after King George III and initially laid out in 1781, George Square is surrounded by architecturally important buildings including on the east side the palatial Municipal Chambers, also known as the City Chambers, whose foundation stone was laid in 1883, and on the west side by the Merchants House. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Square">Read more...</a> </p>

            <h2> Glasgow University </h2>
                <p> The University of Glasgow is a public research university in Glasgow, Scotland. Founded by papal bull in 1451, it is one of Scotland's four ancient universities. Along with the universities of Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and St Andrews, the university was part of the Scottish Enlightenment during the 18th century. Glasgow originally educated students primarily from wealthy backgrounds, however, it became a pioneer in British education by also providing for the needs of students from the working/ middle class. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Glasgow">Read more...</a> </p>

            <h2> During WW2 </h2>
                <p> Clydebank was a hub of industry, producing ships and munitions for Allied forces. This made it a natural target on Germany’s radar. They intended to bomb the John Brown & Company shipyard, a factory which manufactured anti-aircraft and medium-calibre guns, and the Singer Corporation factory, a sewing machine factory which took government weapon contracts during the war. Over the course of the two nights 439 bombers dropped more than 1,000 bombs on Clydebank in what amateur historian Les Taylor called “the most cataclysmic event” in war-time Scotland.
